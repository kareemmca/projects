1) Imagine that I want to do this:
	test.map(pair => pair.swap).sortByKey(false).saveAsTextFile("FILE/results")
	How can I overwrite the results of the var result to the results of the val test in same directory?
a) RDD's saveAsTextFile does not give us the opportunity to do that (DataFrame's have "save modes" for things like append/overwrite/ignore). 
	You'll have to control this prior before (maybe delete or rename existing data) or afterwards (write the RDD as a diff dir and then swap it out).
	
	
2) Difference between map and flatMap ?
   	âžœ  spark-1.6.1 cat test.md
	This is the first line;
	This is the second line;
	This is the last line.
	
	scala> val textFile = sc.textFile("test.md")
	scala> textFile.map(line => line.split(" ")).count()
	res2: Long = 3
	
	scala> textFile.flatMap(line => line.split(" ")).count()
	res3: Long = 15
	
	scala> textFile.map(line => line.split(" ")).collect()
	res0: Array[Array[String]] = Array(Array(This, is, the, first, line;), Array(This, is, the, second, line;), Array(This, is, the, last, line.))
	
	scala> textFile.flatMap(line => line.split(" ")).collect()
	res1: Array[String] = Array(This, is, the, first, line;, This, is, the, second, line;, This, is, the, last, line.)
